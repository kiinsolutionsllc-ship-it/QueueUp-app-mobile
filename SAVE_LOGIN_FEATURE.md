# Save Login Feature Documentation

## Overview
The Save Login feature allows users to securely store their login credentials for convenient future access. This feature has been implemented in both the Customer and Mechanic login screens.

## Features

### üîê Secure Storage
- Uses Expo SecureStore for encrypted storage of credentials
- Credentials are stored locally on the device
- No credentials are sent to external servers

### ‚è∞ Auto-Expiration
- Saved credentials automatically expire after 30 days
- Old credentials are automatically cleared for security

### üéØ User Type Separation
- Customer and Mechanic credentials are stored separately
- Each user type only loads their own saved credentials

### ‚úÖ User Control
- Users can choose to save or not save their login information
- Users can uncheck the option to clear saved credentials
- Clear visual feedback with checkbox UI

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **`src/services/SecureStorageService.ts`** - New service for secure credential storage
2. **`src/screens/auth/CustomerLoginScreen.tsx`** - Added save login functionality
3. **`src/screens/auth/MechanicLoginScreen.tsx`** - Added save login functionality

### Key Components

#### SecureStorageService
- `saveCredentials()` - Saves email, password, and user type
- `getSavedCredentials()` - Retrieves saved credentials with auto-expiration
- `clearSavedCredentials()` - Removes all saved credentials
- `isSaveLoginEnabled()` - Checks if save login is enabled
- `setSaveLoginEnabled()` - Enables/disables save login preference

#### UI Components
- **Checkbox**: Visual indicator for save login preference
- **Auto-fill**: Automatically fills email and password fields when credentials are saved
- **User Type Detection**: Only loads credentials matching the current user type

## Security Features

### üîí Encryption
- Uses Expo SecureStore which provides platform-native encryption
- Credentials are encrypted using device keychain/keystore

### üïí Expiration
- Credentials automatically expire after 30 days
- Prevents indefinite storage of sensitive information

### üßπ Cleanup
- Credentials are cleared when user unchecks save login
- Old credentials are automatically removed

## User Experience

### First Time Login
1. User enters email and password
2. User can check "Save login information" checkbox
3. Upon successful login, credentials are saved (if checkbox is checked)

### Subsequent Logins
1. App automatically loads saved credentials
2. Email and password fields are pre-filled
3. Checkbox is automatically checked
4. User can uncheck to clear saved credentials

### Visual Design
- **Customer Login**: Yellow checkbox (`#EAB308`) matching customer theme
- **Mechanic Login**: Red checkbox (`#DC2626`) matching mechanic theme
- Consistent styling with existing UI components

## Usage Examples

### Saving Credentials
```typescript
// When user successfully logs in with save login checked
if (saveLogin) {
  await SecureStorageService.saveCredentials(email, password, 'customer');
}
```

### Loading Credentials
```typescript
// On app startup or screen load
const result = await SecureStorageService.getSavedCredentials();
if (result.success && result.credentials) {
  setEmail(result.credentials.email);
  setPassword(result.credentials.password);
  setSaveLogin(true);
}
```

### Clearing Credentials
```typescript
// When user unchecks save login or logs out
await SecureStorageService.clearSavedCredentials();
```

## Privacy & Security Considerations

### ‚úÖ What's Secure
- Credentials are encrypted using device keychain
- No network transmission of stored credentials
- Automatic expiration prevents indefinite storage
- User has full control over saving/clearing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- Credentials are stored locally on the device
- If device is compromised, credentials could be accessed
- Users should be aware of this when using on shared devices
- Consider adding biometric authentication for additional security

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Biometric Authentication**: Add fingerprint/face ID for saved credentials
2. **Multiple Accounts**: Support for saving multiple user accounts
3. **Cloud Sync**: Optional cloud backup with user consent
4. **Auto-Login**: Automatic login with saved credentials
5. **Security Notifications**: Alerts for credential access

### Configuration Options
- Configurable expiration time (currently 30 days)
- Option to disable save login feature entirely
- Different security levels for different user types

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Save and Load**: Save credentials, restart app, verify auto-fill
2. **Expiration**: Test automatic cleanup after 30 days
3. **User Type Separation**: Verify customer/mechanic credentials don't mix
4. **Clear Credentials**: Test clearing saved credentials
5. **Security**: Verify credentials are encrypted and not accessible via file system

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Login with save login checked
2. Close and reopen app
3. Verify credentials are auto-filled
4. Uncheck save login and login again
5. Verify credentials are cleared
6. Test with both customer and mechanic accounts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Credentials not saving**: Check SecureStore permissions
2. **Auto-fill not working**: Verify user type matching
3. **Expired credentials**: Check date/time settings
4. **UI not updating**: Verify state management

### Debug Information
- Check console logs for SecureStorageService operations
- Verify Expo SecureStore is properly configured
- Test on both iOS and Android devices
