# AWS Cognito Authentication Fix Guide

## Issue Summary
The `signInWithSRP` error you're experiencing is typically caused by AWS Amplify v6 configuration issues. I've identified and fixed several problems in your authentication setup.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed AWS Configuration (`src/config/awsConfig.ts`)
- **Added missing region parameter** - AWS Amplify v6 requires the region to be explicitly configured
- **Enhanced logging** - Added detailed configuration logging for debugging
- **Improved error handling** - Better error messages and debugging information

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling (`src/services/AWSCognitoService.ts`)
- **Added configuration validation logging** - Shows which environment variables are set/missing
- **Improved error categorization** - Better handling of specific AWS Cognito error codes
- **Enhanced debugging** - More detailed error logging including error cause

### 3. Better User Experience (`src/screens/auth/`)
- **Improved error messages** - More user-friendly error alerts
- **Specific error handling** - Different messages for different types of errors
- **Better debugging** - Console logging for troubleshooting

## Next Steps to Resolve the Issue

### Step 1: Verify Your AWS Cognito User Pool Configuration

1. **Go to AWS Cognito Console**
   - Navigate to your User Pool: `us-east-2_RNDeb3LGm`
   - Go to "App clients" section

2. **Check Authentication Flows**
   - Ensure these flows are enabled:
     - ✅ `ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH` (Required for mobile apps)
     - ✅ `ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH`
   - **Disable** "Generate client secret" (Mobile apps don't use client secrets)

3. **Verify User Pool Settings**
   - Go to "General settings" → "Authentication flows"
   - Ensure SRP authentication is enabled

### Step 2: Test Your Configuration

1. **Restart your development server** to pick up the new configuration
2. **Check the console logs** - You should now see detailed configuration information
3. **Try signing in** - The error messages should be more specific

### Step 3: Create a Test User (if needed)

1. **Go to AWS Cognito Console** → Your User Pool → "Users" tab
2. **Create a test user** with a simple email/password
3. **Confirm the user** (if email confirmation is required)
4. **Test sign-in** with the test credentials

### Step 4: Check Network Connectivity

The error might also be caused by network issues:
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection
- Check if your firewall/proxy is blocking AWS endpoints
- Try from a different network if possible

## Common Error Codes and Solutions

| Error Code | Solution |
|------------|----------|
| `InvalidUserPoolConfigurationException` | Check User Pool authentication flows |
| `NotAuthorizedException` | Verify email/password or user confirmation status |
| `UserNotConfirmedException` | User needs to confirm email address |
| `UserNotFoundException` | User doesn't exist in the User Pool |
| `NetworkError` | Check internet connection and firewall settings |

## Debugging Information

The updated code now provides detailed logging. Check your console for:

```
AWS Amplify: Initializing with configuration: {
  userPoolId: "us-east-2_R...",
  userPoolClientId: "2pql2mbi2...",
  region: "us-east-2"
}
```

If you see "Missing" for any of these values, check your `.env` file.

## If the Issue Persists

1. **Check AWS CloudWatch logs** for your User Pool
2. **Verify your User Pool is in the correct region** (us-east-2)
3. **Ensure your app client is properly configured** for mobile use
4. **Try creating a new User Pool** with default settings as a test

## Testing the Fix

After making these changes:

1. **Restart your Expo development server**
2. **Clear any cached data** (if using Expo Go, restart the app)
3. **Try signing in** with a valid user account
4. **Check the console** for the new detailed logging

The enhanced error handling should now provide much clearer information about what's going wrong, making it easier to identify and fix the root cause.

## Contact Information
